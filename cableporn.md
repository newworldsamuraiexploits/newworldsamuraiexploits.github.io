# My Best Single Rack DataCenter Setup.


How would you manage to setup a datacenter in a cololaction facility 1000 miles away in 4 days and avoid a cabling rat nest nightmare?  
This was a setup from over six years ago so some of the technology is not cutting edge anymore but to this day I am still thrilled with how smoothly this new datacenter turnup went.  But more impotantly is the eye candy.
I had all the equipment shipped to my location from the vendors where I was lucky enough to have spare 42U rack to stage it in.  Once the gear was racked a wiring harness was crafted with four 1.75" diameter wire looms, 
the non split corrugated tubing type, cut to length of a rack rail. Each cut tube was fixed to a server rack rail with zip ties. The wire looms here are racked on each side of U numbers 28 & 34.  The Cat6 cable was feed 
through the looms and cut to length at the ending interfaces then crimpped.  This allowed for a wiring harness to be snapped in and out of the rack with little effort and easily shipped.  The harness would be rack first 
followed by the equipment.
